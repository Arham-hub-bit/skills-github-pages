I am writing this blog for Muhammad Arham. This blog is based on school today. So today I was in school. I arived from bus. The First lesson was steam but Sir.Ahasan took it for a very important lesson in computing.

Ww were learning about HTML which stands for Hypertext Markup language. We were learning that tags are there in Html. We always need to put a / at the end on the tag. we learn different types of tages like: unordered list and h1 till h6 and paragraph and list items. At the end we make our own starter webpage in w3schools.com.
